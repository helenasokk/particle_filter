# particle_filter

This is the repository for my Master's thesis "Vision-based Localization on City Scale Using Open Street Map".

The repository includes:
* roadrobot.py - defines robot class
* motion_planner.py - used for movement of the vehicle/robot and particles
* test.py - main file where the particle filter loop is defined and testing/evaluation happens
* results folder - results of couple of test runs [as GIFs]
* frames folders - figures of particle filter steps during each iteration, number shows the particle count
